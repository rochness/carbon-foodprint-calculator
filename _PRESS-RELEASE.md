# Project Name #

## Heading ##
  Carbon Foodprint Calculator

## Sub-Heading ##
  A calculator to enable chefs and diners to take action against climate change.

## Summary ##

  The Carbon Foodprint Calculator helps to inform chefs, restaurant owners, and restaurant eaters on how the choices they make affect the environment. The app allows the user to enter various ingredients and their corresponding quantities, it then calculates the total amount of CO2 emissions that is generated as a result of producing those ingredients. The user can then substitute ingredients and adjust quantities to find a more climate friendly meal. The calculator will also indicate the dollar amount needed to offset the carbon emissions for the selected ingredients.

## Problem ##
  The global food system accounts for 1/3 of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, yet consumers and businesses alike lack the information needed to make environmentally conscious decisions.

## Solution ##
  The Carbon Foodprint Calculator simplifies the problem by focusing solely on climate change and allows chefs, restauranteers and consumers to better understand their own impact. In addition to informing users of their environmental impact, our organization will work with them to identify areas in which carbon emissions can be reduced or offset.

## Customer Quote ##
 "The Carbon Foodprint Calculator helped us better understand the true cost of our ingredients. We have since substituted certain ingredients in our dishes with more climate friendly alternatives and for the dishes we have that are high emitters, we have raised the prices so that we can use the margin to purchase carbon offsets. We're now on our way to being to zero-carbon restaurant" - Restaurant Owner of Mission Chinese Food
