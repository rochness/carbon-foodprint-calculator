There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Carbon Foodprint Calculator

## Sub-Heading ##
  A calculator to enable chefs and diners to take action against climate change. 

## Summary ##

  The Carbon Foodprint Calculator helps to inform chefs, restaurant owners, and restaurant eaters on how the choices they make affect the environment. The app allows the user to enter various ingredients and their corresponding quantities, it then calculates the total amount of CO2 emissions that is generated as a result of producing those ingredients. The user can then substitute ingredients and adjust quantities to find a more climate friendly meal. The calculator will also indicate the dollar amount needed to offset the carbon emissions for the selected ingredients.  

## Problem ##
  The global food system accounts for 1/3 of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, yet consumers and businesses alike lack the information needed to make environmentally conscious decisions. 

## Solution ##
  The Carbon Foodprint Calculator simplifies the problem by focusing solely on climate change and allows chefs, restauranteers and consumers to better understand their own impact. In addition to informing users of their environmental impact, our organization will work with them to identify areas in which carbon emissions can be reduced or offset.   

## Quote from You ##
  "We want food lovers to lead the fight against climate change." - Rochelle Lee

## How to Get Started ##
  Start using the Carbon Foodprint Calculator now by visiting www.zerofoodprint.org/calculator. Enter ingredients one by one with their corresponding quantities to see how much CO2 is emitted from their production life cycle. In addition to showing the amount of carbon emissions emitted from each individual ingredient, the calculator will also display the grand total. Our user interface makes it easy to modify quantities and ingredients selected to see the updated totals. The calculator will also display the amount of money need to offset your total carbon emissions. 

## Customer Quote ##
 "The Carbon Foodprint Calculator helped us better understand the true cost of our ingredients. We have since substituted certain ingredients in our dishes with more climate friendly alternatives and for the dishes we have that are high emitters, we have raised the prices so that we can use the margin to purchase carbon offsets. We're now on our way to being to zero-carbon restaurant" - Restaurant Owner of Mission Chinese Food
